# Thoughts and TODOs

TODO:
1. Describe (Unknown) error: Starting EDMC while docked at a station.
2. Test selling bonds, bounties at a interstellar factor or carrier.
3. Remove trailing "\n" from activity to prevent window growing too tall.
4. Rename EDMFAT (Elite Dangerous Minor Faction Activity Tracker)?

Does not do:
1. Handle state-specific requirements. E.g. handing in combat bonds to factions in Election or War state will not affect influence.
2. Handle things that are not in journal files, e.g. conflict zones.
