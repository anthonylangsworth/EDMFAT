This a scratch pad to record development-specific details, keeping them separate from user documentation.

# Development Principles

1. Ease of Use. For example, "Copy + Reset" instead of Reset button. Avoid non-game abbreviations in activity.
2. Try to follow in-game values where possible. The journal file sometimes makes that unclear.
3. Keep the code simple. For exampe, eschew plug-ins or dependencies unless necessary.

# TODO

1. Add to troubleshooting: Missing data if EDMC started while docked.
2. Looking system if not found, e.g. handing in a wing mission.
3. Test passenger missions
4. Killing clean ships
5. Add troubleshooting, e.g. %userprofile%\AppData\Local\EDMarketConnector\plugins\EDMFAT, %TEMP%\EDMarketConnector.log
