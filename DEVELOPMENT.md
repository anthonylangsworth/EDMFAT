This a scratch pad to record development-specific details, keeping them separate from user documentation.

TODO:
1. Add to troubleshooting: Missing data if EDMC started while docked.
2. Test selling bonds, bounties at a interstellar factor or carrier in game.
3. Missions
4. Passenger missions
5. Killing clean ships

Does not do:
1. Handle state-specific requirements. E.g. handing in combat bonds to factions in Election or War state will not affect influence.
2. Handle things that are not in journal files, e.g. conflict zones.
