# Thoughts and TODOs

1. Shift business logic to module for easy testing and sharing.
2. Continue test framework.

Does not do:
1. Handle state-specific requirements. E.g. handing in combat bonds to factions in Election or War state will not affect influence.
2. Handle things that are not in journal files, e.g. conflict zones.
