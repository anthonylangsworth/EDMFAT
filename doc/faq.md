## Frequently Asked Questions

## The activity shown is incorrect. For example, a mission influence reward is incorrect. How do we fix this?

Unfortunately, **Elite: Dangerous** occasionally records incorrect mission influence values. See the [discussion on missions](missions.md).

Assuming the problem is not due to know issues with missions, please either:
1. [Raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/anthonylangsworth/EDMFAT/issues) or
2. Contact me via social media links in [my Github profile](https://github.com/anthonylangsworth).

I will need:
1. The relevant journal file(s) from the play session. These are usually found in `%userprofile%\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\` in the form of `Journal.YYYYMMDDHHmmSS.01.log` where YYYYMMDDHHmmSS is a date and time in reverse order.
2. An explanation of what should have happenned. For exmaple, if sold catography data does not appear, please tell me where you sold it and when.

## I installed the EDMC plug-in but it is not appearing. How do I fix this?
